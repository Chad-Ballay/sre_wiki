This is a collection of resources and things I've learned throughout my time in cloud systems development and operations.

## Mantras
* Ensure "Canary" deployments with fraction of traffic/instances.
* Don't admire the problem, rollback first, root cause later.
* Standardize monitoring, narrow down metrics.
* Don't alert on every problem. Monitor user pain and alert on those.
