This is a collection of resources and things I've learned throughout my time in cloud systems development and operations. A lot of things were taken off of websites or books that I've never recorded sources of. If you recognize the source or are the owner of said information, I'd love to link you. I in no way claim I manufactured all of this information on my own.
