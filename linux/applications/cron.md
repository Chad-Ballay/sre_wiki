## Cron under different users

Only `/etc/crontab` and the files in `/etc/cron.d/` have a username field. In that file you can do this:

`1 1 * * * username /path/to/your/script.sh`

From root's crontab sudo crontab -e you can use:

`1 1 * * * su username -c "/path/to/your/script.sh"`

Or you can use the user's actual crontab like this:

`sudo crontab -u username -e`

The second column in any crontab file is for the hour that you want the job to run at. Did you mean the sixth field?
