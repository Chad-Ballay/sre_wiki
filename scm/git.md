## Create branch and checkout
Checkout and create branch locally
`git checkout -b <branch> `

## Commit and add all files
`git commit -am "MESSAGE" `

## Tie remote branch to remote branch
`git push -u origin <remote branch> `

## View git log
`git log --decorate `

## Delete a remote branch
`git push origin :<branch> `

## Delete a local branch
_You should be in master for this_
`git branch -D <branch> `

## Amend
`git add <whatever> `
`git commit --amend --no-edit `

## Fixing Merge Conflicts
Step 1: Fetch the changes (saving the target branch as FETCH_HEAD).
`git fetch origin master`
Step 2: Checkout the source branch and merge in the changes from the target branch. Resolve conflicts.
`git checkout feature/<branch>`
`git merge FETCH_HEAD`
Step 3: After the merge conflicts are resolved, stage the changes accordingly, commit the changes and push.
`git commit`
`git push origin HEAD`
